Test case E:

    Allocate 2000 bytes. Then allocate 1 byte. Then free the 2000 bytes.

    Allocate 1 byte 50 times. 

    Free all bytes

    The purpose is to test the splitting algorithm. Having 1 byte allocated after the 2000 byte block means that 
    the following 1 byte allocations will cause a new metadata block to form in between metadata blocks.
    

Test case F:

    Allocate 1 byte, then 2 bytes, then 3 bytes... until 50 bytes.

    Free every ptr that points to an even number of bytes.

    Then reallocate all even numbers up to 50.

    Then free everything.

    The purpose is to test the first-fit algorithm implemented. The even numbered bytes should reallocate in the same
    block that they were initially in.
